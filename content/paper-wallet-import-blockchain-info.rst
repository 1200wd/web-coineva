You have `created a Blockchain.info wallet <{filename}/create-blockchain-info-wallet.rst>`_
so log in and continue to transfer the funds from your paper wallet.

To import your paper wallet go to the settings menu and select addresses. Then click on
import address and enter your private key. The private key will be validated and the funds
from your paper wallet will be transferred to the Blockchain.info wallet. If you want to
send coins from your Blockchain wallet right away, use priority fee, otherwise you might have
to wait a couple of hours.

Please note: Normally never enter your private key on any website! However blockchain.info is
well-known and established, and their website is set up in such a way that your private keys are
not sent to their servers. However, for larger amount of bitcoins and / or long term storage I
would advise to use a local hardware or software wallet.

`sell your bitcoins on Bitonic <{filename}/sell-bitcoins-on-bitonic.rst>`_
