Login to your `Blockchain.info Wallet <{filename}/create-blockchain-info-wallet.rst>`_
or open another wallet you own and go to https://bitonic.nl

Fill in the amount of bitcoins you would like to sell and the return bitcoin address.
The bitcoin address can be same address as you send the bitcoins from, or you can request
a new address from your wallet if you are concerned about privacy.

If you would like to sell the full amount please do not forget to deduct the transaction fees.
So transfer the full amount of your wallet minus the expected transaction fees. You can
find the expected transaction fee when you click on 'Send' in the Blockchain.info wallet.

your transaction through in a couple of hours normally.
