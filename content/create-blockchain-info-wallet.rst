Now go to security settings to verify your email. You can disable TOR if you do not use it.

Next backup your passphrase by writing down the 12 words on a piece of paper and store them
in a safe place. You can restore you wallet in case you have forgotten your password,
or if Blockchain.info might disappear. But anyone who
finds this paper can also use your bitcoins.

or buy some bitcoins.
